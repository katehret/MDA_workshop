# How to do Multi-dimensional Analysis: Theoretical background and practical analyses in R

Workshop held May 22 and 23, 2024, at Simon Fraser University, Burnaby


### About 

This repository contains slides, scripts, data and additional material for conducting a multi-dimensional analysis, including various visualisations. The data and scripts have been adapted from the multi-dimensional analysis presented in

* Ehret, Katharina, and Maite Taboada. (2021). [“Characterising online news comments: a multi-dimensional cruise through online registers”](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frai.2021.643770/full). _Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence_. 4(79): 10.3389/frai.2021.643770.


### File and folder structure

* :file_folder: data -- the normalised frequency counts and additional material needed for the FA

* :file_folder: interpretation -- spreadsheets with salient loadings and comments, distributional graphs, some example corpus files

* :file_folder: scripts -- .r scripts and .Rmd scripts

* :computer: mda_slides.pdf: slides presented during the workshop

> [!TIP]
> For running the .Rmd scripts in R studio the scripts need to be moved up one directory level. Else the folder structure should be left intact. Make sure to unzip the normalized_postag_counts.zip folder.
